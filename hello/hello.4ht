% provide configure for \hello command. we can choose any name
% but most convenient is to name hooks after redefined command
% we declare two hooks, to be inserted before and after the command
\NewConfigure{hello}{2}
% now we need to redefine \hello. save it to tmp command
\let\tmp:hello\hello
% note that `:` can be part of command name in `.4ht` files.
% now insert the hooks. they are named as \a:hook, \b:hook, ..., \h:hook
% depending on how many hooks were declared
\renewcommand\hello{\a:hello\tmp:hello\b:hello}
